I created my Mandala output using the p5.js Web Editor. It wasn't really easy at all but with the help of my sources : https://www.youtube.com/user/matthewepler I did it. I only make it simple since I am not still familiar with the web editor but I'm glad it turned out well. As you look at the pattern it created a sun or a sunflower look alike. i made this because the sun give us light. Sunflowers also follow where the sun shines and that reminds me that darkness isn't strong if we are able to fix our focus where the brightness is.

Also, I wanted to learn more about other languages and how to create art patterns using it.
